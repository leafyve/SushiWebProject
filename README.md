# SushiWebProject
Sushi Web Project from JavaScript Mastery Youtube Channel, made a few tweaks in the content to be 
more realistic and relatable to the place I'm staying. 

There was a few errors that popped up when following this project, such as the animations not fading in at all 
with the data-aos, it could be because the video was uploaded 2 years ago as of May 2025, but I've managed to solve 
the bug by including some codes to allow the animation to flow normally again (refer to index.html and js)

I hope this helps anyone who followed this project!
