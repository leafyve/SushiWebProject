# SushiWebProject
Sushi Web Project from JavaScript Mastery Youtube Channel, made a few tweaks in the content to be 
more realistic and relatable to place I'm staying. 

There was a few errors that popped up when following this project such as the animations not fading in at all 
with the data-aos, could be because the video was uploaded 2 years ago as of May 2025, buyt I've managed to solve 
the bug by including some codes to allow the animation to flow normally again (refer to index.html and js)

Hope this helps anyone that followed this project!
